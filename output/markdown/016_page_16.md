The need to learn how to use text editors in Linux is indisputable. Every system administrator and engineer deal with configuration (plain text) files on a daily basis, and most times this is done purely using one or more tools from a command-line interface (such as **nano**, **vi**, or **emacs**).

### vi

The vi editor (visual editor) is almost certainly on every Linux and UNIX system. In fact, if a system has just one editor, it’s probably vi, so it’s worth knowing your way around in vi.

Using vi editor, we can edit an existing file or create a new file from scratch. we can also use this editor to just read a text file.

> vi editor is great even trough ssh sessions!

#### vi or vim ?

Most Linux distributions now ship with the vim (for **V**i **IM**proved) editor rather than classic vi. Vim is upward compatible with vi and has a graphical mode available (gvim) as well as the standard vi text mode interface. The `vi` command is usually an alias or symbolic link to the vim program.

There are several versions of vim: tiny, small, normal, big, and huge. We can find out what version of vim we are running and what features are included by using the command(ubuntu 16.04 here ):

Inorder to read, create or modify a file with vi, give the file name to it:

**if you just type vi(m) and hit enter, the vi(m) version will be displayed:**

Okey lets start learning vi(m):

### vi modes

Vim actually has three modes: **insert mode**, **command mode**, and **escape**  **(last-line) mode**. Let’s start with the default mode you’ll see when you start up Vim–command mode.

* **command mode** : When you run vim filename to edit a file, Vim starts out in command mode. This means that all the alphanumeric keys are bound to commands, rather than inserting those characters.(save, quit, search/replace, navigate around, execute macros,...)
* **insert mode** : *To enter the insert mode, type i (for “insert”)* and now the keys will behave as you’d expect. You can type normally until you want to make a correction, save the file, or perform another operation that’s reserved for command mode or escape (last-line) mode. *To get out of insert mode, hit the Escape key.*
* **escape (last-line) mode** : Once you press Escape, you’re in command mode again. What if you’d like to save your file or search through your document? No problem, *press : and Vim will switch to escape (last-line) mode*. Vim is now waiting for you to enter a command like :w to write the file or :q to exit the editor.

If that all sounds complicated, it’s really not. It does take a few days to start training your brain to move between the modes and memorizing the most important keys for movement, commands, and so on.

#### Moving the cursor

The first thing you’ll want to learn is how to move around a file. When you’re in command mode, you’ll want to remember the following keys and what they do:

Key

function

h

Move left one character on the current line

j

Move down to the next line

k

Move up to the previous line

l

Move right one character on the current line

w

Move to the next word on the current line

e

Move to the next end of word on the current line

b

Move to the previous beginning of the word on the current line

Crtl-f

Scroll forward one page

Ctrl-b

Scroll backward one page

> If you type a number before any of these commands, then the command will be executed that many times. This number is called a *repetition count* or simply *count*. For example, 5h will move left five characters. You can use repetition counts with many vi commands.

#### Jumping

key

function

H

move to top of screen

M

move to middle of screen

L

move to bottom of screen

key

function

W

jump forwards to the start of a word (words can contain punctuation)

E

jump forwards to the end of a word (words can contain punctuation)

B

jump backwards to the start of a word (words can contain punctuation)

key

function

0

jump backwards to the start of line

^

jump to the first non-blank character of the line

$

jump to the end of the line

g\_

jump to the last non-blank character of the line

gg

go to the first line of the document

G

go to the last line of the document

### Editing text

Now that you can open a file in vi, move around it and get out, it’s time to learn how to edit the text in the file

key( for inserting)

function

i

insert text before cursor, until hit

I

insert text at beginning of current line, until hit

a

append text after cursor, until hit

A

append text to end of current line, until hit

o

open and put text in a new line below current line, until hit

O

open and put text in a new line above current line, until hit

key(for changing)

function

r

replace single character under cursor (no needed)

R

replace characters, starting with current cursor position, until hit

cw

change the current word with new text, starting with the character under cursor, until hit

cNw

change N words beginning with character under cursor, until hit; e.g., c5w changes 5 words

C

change (replace) the characters in the current line, until hit

cc

change (replace) the entire current line, stopping when is hit

Ncc or cNc

change (replace) the next N lines, starting with the current line, stopping when is hit

key (for deleting)

function

x

delete single character under cursor

Nx

delete N characters, starting with character under cursor

dw

delete the single word beginning with character under cursor

dNw

delete N words beginning with character under cursor; e.g., d5w deletes 5 words

d^

delete start of line till the cursor

d$ and D

delete the remainder of the line, starting with current cursor position

dd

delete entire current line

Ndd or dNd

delete N lines, beginning with the current line; e.g., 5dd deletes 5 lines

key(for cutting and pasting)

function

yy

copy (yank, cut) the current line into the buffer

Nyy or yNy

copy (yank, cut) the next N lines, including the current line, into the buffer

p

put (paste) the line(s) in the buffer into the text after the current line

P

put (paste) the line(s) in the buffer into the text before the current line

### searching

key

function

/string

search forward for occurrence of string in text

? string

search backward for occurrence of string in text

n

move to next occurrence of search string

N

move to next occurrence of search string in opposite direction

### replacing

key

function

:s/old/new/

replace first old with new in just that line

:s/old/new/g

replace all old with new in just that line

:%s/old/new/g

replace all old with new throughout file

:%s/old/new/gc

replace all old with new throughout file with confirmations

:%s/old/new/gic

same as above but case insensitive

:noh

remove highlighting of search matches

### Exiting

If you’re in insert mode, hit Escape. Then enter : and you’ll see a line at the bottom of the screen with a cursor ready to take input.

key

function

:w

That will write the file to the existing filename,but don't exit.

:w *file*

If you don’t have a filename or want to write out to a different *file name*

:q

quit (fails if there are unsaved changes)

:q!

Quit editing without saving.

:wq

write (save) and quit (throw and error if file is not writable)

:wq!

try to write and quit (if it is not writable, quit without saving! )

ZZ and :x

Exit and save the file if modified

q! or ZQ

quit and throw away unsaved changes

Press ESC to return back to the normal command mode!

> When you want to write and exit from a file consider you permissions, the bellow command write out the current file using sudo:
>
> :w !sudo tee %
>
> * :w – Write a file (actually buffer).
> * !sudo – Call shell with sudo command.
> * tee – The output of write (vim :w) command redirected using tee.
> * % – The % is nothing but current file name.

### reloading

key

function

:e

(short for `:edit`) reload the file from the disk

:e!

it will discard local changes and reload.

### VIM Tip : running external commands in a shell

It usuaslly happens that we need to run a command in shell to see the result of file which we are edditing. It could be happened in two ways:

1.We could suspend your session (ctrl-Z), and then run the command in your shell.That’s a lot of keystrokes, though !

2.So, instead, you could use vim’s built-in “run a shell command”:

> :!cmd Run a shell command, shows you the output and prompts you before returning to your current buffer.

### help

Need help? you can use `:help` or `:help keyword` and vim will open help for keyword.
