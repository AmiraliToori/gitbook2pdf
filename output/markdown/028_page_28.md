A Linux desktop environment is a collection of applications designed to work well with each other and provide a consistent user experience. A desktop environment is usually paired with a login manager. The login manager also known as a greeter or display manager

#### What is Display Manager ?

The display manager is a bit of code that provides the GUI login screen for your Linux desktop. After you log in to a GUI desktop, the display manager turns control over to the window manager.

> Kernel -> X -> DisplayManager -> Desktop

When you log out of the desktop, the display manager is given control again to display the login screen and wait for another login.

There are several display managers—some are provided with their respective desktops while some others not.

Any of the display managers can be used for your login screen regardless of which desktop you are using. Such is the flexibility of Linux and well-written, modular code.

### LightDM

LightDM is a free and open-source X display manager that aims to be lightweight, fast, extensible and multi-desktop.

> **LightDM** is the display manager running in Ubuntu up to version 16.04 LTS. While it has been replaced by GDM in later Ubuntu releases

### /etc/lightdm

LightDM configuration is located in /etc/lightdm directory:

lets see some confiurations inside /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf :

In some distributions (ubuntu )configuration files are located inside lightdm.conf.d directory:

#### changing greeter session:

For instance lets install another greeter session for lightdm and test it

next we need to edit lightdm.conf and change line bellow:

restart lightdm using `systemctl restart lightdm` and see the result:

#### Controlling Display managers

Installing and switching between different Display Managers is pretty easy , as we have seen in CentOS, we can install new DM via `yum /apt` commands. Next some modifications in configuration files might be needed example `/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf` .And finally we should enable previous DM and enable the new one with `systemctl enable/disable lightdm` commands and `reboot`.

For disabling Display Manager ang going to text mode it depends on your distribution! We can either use `telinit` command or set default target via `systemctl set-default` command.
