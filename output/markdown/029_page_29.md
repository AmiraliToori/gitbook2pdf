There are some people with disabilities . A disability is any condition that makes it more difficult for a person to do certain activities or interact with the world around them. People with disabilities might like to work with Linux too . The good news is that Linux distributions provide great advantages over proprietary alternatives for people with disabilities!

#### What is Accessibility?

Accessibility , means making software usable by disabled people. That includes blind people of course, but also people who have low vision, are deaf, colorblind, have only one hand, can move only a few fingers, or even only the eyes.

These options are available in display managers (login screen) and in major desktops (like gnome, kde, xfce, ...). Its logo is a human stretching its hands a legs.

> In Gnome the config is located at Settings ~ Universal Access.

Linux provides accessibility in 3 sections:

1. **AccessX :****AccessX** or the **Keyboard Accessibility** preference tool allows you to set some options for people who have difficulty with keyboard .
2. **Visual Settings :** Visual Settings help people with vision problems:
3. **Assistive Technologies :** things like text-to-speech (tts)

### AccessX

* **Sticky keys**: Helps users who have trouble pressing multiple keys at once, and users who have use of only one hand
* **Slow keys** allows the user to specify the duration for which one must press-and-hold a **key** before the system accepts the keypress.
* **BounceKeys:** Requires a delay between keystrokes before accepting the next keypress .
* **MouseKeys:** Enables a group of keys to emulate a mouse. Pressing keys in this group will move a pointer around the screen and perform mouse button actions.
* **RepeatKeys:** Enables the user who has trouble releasing keys quickly once they press to slow down how fast keys start repeating once they're pressed.
* **Hover Click:**  Enable **click** or drag simply by **hovering** **mouse** pointer over a control or object on the screen.

### Visual Settings

* **High-contrast** : Helps users who have trouble seeing text unless contrast is corrected, such as white text on a black background, or vice versa.
* **zoom (Magnifier)** : Helps users with visual impairments who need larger text and images.
* **Large Text**: Make reading text easier by using larger fonts in menus.
* **On screen keyboard**: Helps users who cannot type at all, but who can use a mouse.

**GOK** is the *Gnome On-Screen Keyboard*. As the title implies, it is a keyboard that appears on the display as an alternative for those who are not able to use a regular keyboard.

* **Visual alerts**: Replace system sounds with visual cues(like flashing th e screen)
* **Screen reader**: A text-to-speech system to read what's on the screen

### Text to speech

There are some Text to speech software in Linux which read dialog boxes for us . Software like **orca** and **emac speak** .
